<h2>Simple Error Handling </h2>
I have created two pug templates which are error.pug and page-not-found.pug. These template will handle errors such as when an error has occured in my code and an error that handles routes where a specified link does not exist. <br/>

I customized my portfolio and made changes on the following items: <br/>
<ul>
    <li>Font - Roboto Slab (Google font)</li> <br/>
    <li>Background Color - #C17442 </li> <br/>
    <li>Color - I have changed the font color for the side to #FFF to fit the new background color  </li> <br/>
</ul>
<br/>
